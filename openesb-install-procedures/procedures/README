#===============================================================================#

QUICK START.
============

1. Unzip this package into the standard BRISSKit install directory 
   (ie: to /var/local/brisskit/openesb)
2. Edit the set.sh file within the /var/local/brisskit/openesb/bin/global directory of the install package.
   'Source' the set.sh file at the start of any shell session.
   (There should be no need to do this as sudo or root)
   Use "source ./set.sh" or ". ./set.sh" at the command line or within a composition script.
   Remember, if you execute any script as sudo, then you must inherit the environment variables; eg:
   > sudo -E ./1-acquisitions.sh job-20130214
3  Review configuration settings within the config directory.
4. The order of completion is by number within the procedures/bin/installs directory
   Alternatively, use the composed script OPENESB_INSTALL_PROCS_HOME/compositions/install-all.sh 
   
NOTE WELL.
===========
The default administrator and password on installation are:
user:     admin
password: admin.....

That is, the password is 'admin' followed by 5 dots.
